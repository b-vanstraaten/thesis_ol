\begin_layout Chapter
Tuning qubits using Novel Measurements on Next Generation Instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently the quantum computing industry is exploring many different qubit
 implementations.
 Each implementation has unique set of advantages which are viciously promoted
 by the researchers who work with them.
 At the time of writing superconducting qubits are most mature, with Alphabet
 and Google demonstrating NISQ computation with qubits respectively.
 However, the Ion Trap community emphisises quality over quantity, therefore
 they claim the best quantum volume of the qubit implementations 
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The quantum volume is the largest random circuit of equal width (number
 of qubits) and depth (number of gates) that can implemented.
 Rather akin to a researchers H-index, with their number of papers and number
 of citations on those papers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 By both these metrics semiconducting fall short, a fact that, if raised
 with one of their advocates, will be quickly countered with along the lines
 of: the race to fault tolerant quantum computing is a marathon not a sprint,
 by leveraging the mature classical semiconducting industry we will be able
 scale more effectively.
 In short there isn't a consensus on which qubit is best.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite their differences, each of these qubit implentations are just two-level
 quantum systems which will sit in the fridge (or photonic lattice) doing
 nothing without the classical control electronics.
 In fact classical control electronics are integral for 
\begin_inset Formula $3/5$
\end_inset

 of DiVincenzo's criteria, namely initialisation, control and readout.
 Furthermore, while not one of DiVincenzo's criteria, it is believed that
 error correction will be vital in Fault tolerant quantum computation.
 From a control electronics point of view error correction is difficult,
 requiring low latency readout then a control pulse dependant on the what
 is readout.
 Such latencies explicitely require dedicated FPGA circuitry.
 Therefore, qubit research has promoted componies to develop new control
 hardware.
 One prominate example of these new instruments is the Quantum machine OPX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I will describe the OPX and how it changed measurements
 in the lab.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Quantum Machines OPX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantum machines OPX is their singular product.
 This isn't sign of an incomplete product lineup, but a new direction for
 control electronics.
 The OPX is designed to be an all in one instrument with waveform generation
 and digitisation capabilities, both at a rate of

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While having both of these capabilites in one instrument is unusual it
 is the instruments FPGA processor which makes the instrument powerful.
 At the core of the instrument, coordinating everything, is a programable
 FPGA.
 It sythesises digital waveforms to be output by the instrument, digitally
 demodulate and even perform the ultra low latency classical logic necessary
 for error correction.
 The user interacts with this FPGA through a language called QUA, which
 is then compiled to run deterministically on the FPGA.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of Semiconducting qubits QUA enabled us to control the device
 in intricate ways enabling novel measurements, which have helped us the
 tuning of semiconducting qubits.
 However, before I describe these measurements I will discuss how I set
 the OPX up in our lab, illustrating features of the OPX along the way.

Setting up the OPX

In this section I will describe the sequence of measurements I took to character
ise our experiment setup and thus to appropriately choose configuration
 values for the OPX.
 The order these measurements are presented is the order in which they were
 performed in our lab, and the examples will be presented with QUA code

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Controllers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The controllers dictionary specifies the ports in use one one or more OPX.
 Any unallocated ports are free to be used concurrently for other experiments.
 In addition, for each analog output port it is possible to specifiy a digital
 filter which can be used to precompensate any pulse played to that port
 for the effect of any filters, bias-tees, mixers or amplifiers between
 the OPX and the sample.
 The filter is applied to the digital signal output by FPGA processor before
 it reaches the DACs to be sythesised into an analog waveform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A general digital filter with input 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 and output 
\begin_inset Formula $y[n]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 indexes the timestep, implements the following equation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y[n]=\sum_{m=1}^{M}a_{m}y[n-m]+\sum_{k=0}^{K}b_{k}x[n-k],
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\{a_{m}\}_{m=1}^{M}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{b_{k}\}_{k=0}^{K}$
\end_inset

 are the set of feedback and feedforward coefficients respectively, or taps,
 which completely specify the action of the filter.
 Through careful choice of these filter coefficients it is possible to design
 an digital filter which will predistort the digital waveform sythesised
 by the DACs such that waveform which arrives at the sample, post distortion
 by any filters, bias-tees, mixers or amplifiers, is exactly as intended.
 This will be true irrespective of the waveform.
 Therefore, once the filter coefficients are calibrated the user is able
 to shape waveforms free from the burden of manual filter compensation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will discuss how to obtain the filter coefficients for the high-pass filtering
 effect introduced by a bias-tee later, for now figure

Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elements dictionary provides a level of abstraction on top of the ports.
 It allows the user to group ports together to perform specific operations.
 For example a pair of ports which act as the input for an IQ mixer or an
 output port and a input port drive a reflectometry matching circuit with
 an RF tone are then measure the reflection.

High Frame Rate Two Dimensional Acqusitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High frame rate two dimensional acqusitions of the charge stability, where
 a preprogrammed pulse sequency is played prior to measuring each pixel
 try to envoke Pauli spin blockade.
 Previously the high framerate acquistions have been accomplised by a handful
 of groups around the world, however, to my knowledge never have the high
 framerate acqusitons been combined with pulse sequences.
 Thus this novel measurement can search for spin physics significanly faster
 than any method before.
